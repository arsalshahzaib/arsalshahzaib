- 👋 Hi, I’m @arsalshahzaib. This is my university Github profile.
- 👀 I’m interested in persuing a career in Cybersecurity and carrying on my passion for gaming and streaming.
- 🌱 I’m currently struggling in completing my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from an institute that i would prefer to stay unknown as it's not a good one and i don't suggest anyone to go there.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment but i might be interested in starting an internship at a Cybersec firm.
- 📫 You can reach me by contacting on either here or email me @ arsalshahzaib@outlook.com
